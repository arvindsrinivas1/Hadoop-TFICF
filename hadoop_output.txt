[verse 1]
they come from everywhere
a longing to be free
they come to join us here
from sea to shining sea and they all have a dream
as people always will
to be safe and warm
in that shining city on the hill some wanna slam the door
instead of opening the gate
aw lets turn this thing around
before it gets too late [chorus]
its up to me and you
love can conquer hate
i know this to be true
thats what makes us great [verse 2]
dont tell me a lie
and sell it as a fact
ive been down that road before
and i aint goin back and dont you brag to me
that you never read a book
i never put my faith
in a con man and his crooks i wont follow down that path
and tempt the hands of fate
aw lets turn this thing around
before it gets too late [chorus]
its up to me and you
love can conquer hate
i know this to be true
thats what makes us great in the quiet of the night
i lie here wide awake
and i ask myself
is there a difference i can make [chorus]
its up to me and you
love can conquer hate
i know this to be true
thats what makes us great i come from down in the valley
where mister when youre young
they bring you up to do like your daddy done
me and mary we met in high school
when she was just seventeen
wed ride out of this valley down to where the fields were green
wed go down to the river
and into the river wed dive
oh down to the river wed ride then i got mary pregnant
and man that was all she wrote
and for my nineteenth birthday i got a union card and a wedding coat
we went down to the courthouse
and the judge put it all to rest
no wedding day smiles no walk down the aisle
no flowers no wedding dress that night we went down to the river
and into the river wed dive
oh down to the river we did ride i got a job working construction for the johnstown company
but lately there aint been much work on account of the economy
now all them things that seemed so important
well mister they vanished right into the air
now i just act like i dont remember
mary acts like she dont care but i remember us riding in my brothers car
her body tan and wet down at the reservoir
at night on them banks id lie awake
and pull her close just to feel each breath shed take
now those memories come back to haunt me
they haunt me like a curse
is a dream a lie if it dont come true
or is it something worse
that sends me down to the river
though i know the river is dry
that sends me down to the river tonight
down to the river
my baby and i
oh down to the river we ride the screen door slams marys dress waves
like a vision she dances across the porch as the radio plays
roy orbison singing for the lonely
hey thats me and i want you only
dont turn me home again i just cant face myself alone again
dont run back inside darling you know just what im here for
so youre scared and youre thinking that maybe we aint that young anymore
show a little faith theres magic in the night
you aint a beauty but hey youre alright
oh and thats alright with me you can hide neath your covers and study your pain
make crosses from your lovers throw roses in the rain
waste your summer praying in vain
for a savior to rise from these streets
well now i aint no hero thats understood
all the redemption i can offer girl is beneath this dirty hood
with a chance to make it good somehow
hey what else can we do now
except roll down the window and let the wind blow back your hair
well the nights busting open these two lanes will take us anywhere
we got one last chance to make it real
to trade in these wings on some wheels
climb in back heavens waiting on down the tracks oh oh come take my hand
were riding out tonight to case the promised land
oh oh oh oh thunder road
oh thunder road oh thunder road
lying out there like a killer in the sun
hey i know its late we can make it if we run
oh oh oh oh thunder road
sit tight take hold thunder road well i got this guitar and i learned how to make it talk
and my cars out back if youre ready to take that long walk
from your front porch to my front seat
the doors open but the ride aint free
and i know youre lonely for words that i aint spoken
but tonight well be free all the promisesll be broken there were ghosts in the eyes of all the boys you sent away
they haunt this dusty beach road in the skeleton frames of burned-out chevrolets
they scream your name at night in the street
your graduation gown lies in rags at their feet
and in the lonely cool before dawn
you hear their engines rolling on
but when you get to the porch theyre gone on the wind
so mary climb in
its a town full of losers im pulling out of here to win i get up in the evening
and i aint got nothing to say
i come home in the morning
i go to bed feeling the same way
i aint nothing but tired
man im just tired and bored with myself
hey there baby i could use just a little help you cant start a fire
you cant start a fire without a spark

im trapped in the day we sweat it out on the streets of a runaway american dream
at night we ride through the mansions of glory in suicide machines
sprung from cages out on highway nine
chrome wheeled fuel injectedand steppin out over the line
h-oh baby this town rips the bones from your back
its a death trap its a suicide rap
we gotta get out while were young
`cause tramps like us baby we were born to run yes girl we were wendy let me in i wanna be your friend
i want to guard your dreams and visions
just wrap your legs round these velvet rims
and strap your hands cross my engines
together we could break this trap
well run till we drop baby well never go back
h-oh will you walk with me out on the wire
`cause baby im just a scared and lonely rider
but i gotta know how it feels
i want to know if love is wild
babe i want to know if love is real oh can you show me beyond the palace hemi-powered drones scream down the boulevard
girls comb their hair in rearview mirrors
and the boys try to look so hard
the amusement park rises bold and stark
kids are huddled on the beach in a mist
i wanna die with you wendy on the street tonight
in an everlasting kiss one two three four the highways jammed with broken heroes on a last chance power drive
everybodys out on the run tonight
but theres no place left to hide
together wendy we can live with the sadness
ill love you with all the madness in my soul
h-oh someday girl i dont know when
were gonna get to that place
where we really wanna go
and well walk in the sun
but till then tramps like us
baby we were born to run oh honey tramps like us
baby we were born to run come on with me tramps like us
baby we were born to run men walking long the railroad tracks
going someplace theres no going back
highway patrol choppers coming up over the ridge
hot soup on a campfire under the bridge
shelter line stretching round the corner
welcome to the new world order
families sleeping in the cars in the southwest
no home no job no peace no rest well the highway is alive tonight
but nobodys kidding nobody about where it goes
im sitting down here in the campfire light
searching for the ghost of tom joad he pulls a prayer book out of his sleeping bag
preacher lights up a butt and he takes a drag
waiting for when the last shall be first and the first shall be last
in a cardboard box neath the underpass
you got a one-way ticket to the promised land
you got a hole in your belly and a gun in your hand
sleeping on a pillow of solid rock
bathing in the citys aqueduct go well the highway is alive tonight
where its headed everybody knows
im sitting down here in the campfire light
waiting on the ghost of tom joad now tom said mom wherever theres a cop beating a guy
wherever a hungry newborn baby cries
where theres a fight against the blood and hatred in the air
look for me mom ill be there wherever somebodys fighting for a place to stand
or a decent job or a helping hand
wherever somebodys struggling to be free
look in their eyes ma and youll see me
yeah the highway is alive tonight
where its headed everybody knows
im sitting down here in the campfire light

waitin on a sunny day madman drummers bummers and indians in the summer with a teenage diplomat
in the dumps with the mumps as the adolescent pumps his way into his hat
with a boulder on my shoulder feelin kinda older i tripped the merry-go-round
with this very unpleasing sneezing and wheezing the calliope crashed to the ground
some all-hot half-shot was headin for the hot spot snappin his fingers clappin his hands
and some fleshpot mascot was tied into a lovers knot with a whatnot in her hand
and now young scott with a slingshot finally found a tender spot and throws his lover in the sand
and some bloodshot forget-me-not whispers daddys within earshot save the buckshot turn up the band and she was blinded by the light
oh cut loose like a deuce another runner in the night
blinded by the light
she got down but she never got tight but shell make it alright some brimstone baritone anti-cyclone rolling stone preacher from the east
he says dethrone the dictaphone hit it in its funny bone thats where they expect it least
and some new-mown chaperone was standin in the corner all alone watchin the young girls dance
and some fresh-sown moonstone was messin with his frozen zone to remind him of the feeling of romance yeah he was blinded by the light
oh cut loose like a deuce another runner in the night
blinded by the light
he got down but he never got tight but hes gonna make it tonight some silicone sister with her managers mister told me i got what it takes
she said ill turn you on sonny to something strong if you play that song with the funky break
and go-cart mozart was checkin out the weather chart to see if it was safe to go outside
and little early-pearly came by in her curly-wurly and asked me if i needed a ride
oh some hazard from harvard was skunked on beer playin backyard bombardier
yes and scotland yard was trying hard they sent some dude with a calling card he said do what you like but dont do it here
well i jumped up turned around spit in the air fell on the ground and asked him which was the way back home
he said take a right at the light keep goin straight until night and then boy youre on your own
and now in zanzibar a shootin star was ridin in a side car hummin a lunar tune
yes and the avatar said blow the bar but first remove the cookie jar were gonna teach those boys to laugh too soon
and some kidnapped handicap was complainin that he caught the clap from some mousetrap he bought last night
well i unsnapped his skull cap and between his ears i saw a gap but figured hed be all right he was just blinded by the light

i combed my hair till it was just right and commanded the night brigade
i was open to pain and crossed by the rain and i walked on a crooked crutch
i strolled all alone through a fallout zone and come out with my soul untouched
i hid in the clouded wrath of the crowd but when they said sit down i stood up
oohgrowin up the flag of piracy flew from my mast my sails were set wing to wing
i had a jukebox graduate for first mate she couldnt sail but she sure could sing
i pushed b-52 and bombed them with the blues with my gear set stubborn on standing
i broke all the rules strafed my old high school never once gave thought to landing
i hid in the clouded wrath of the crowd but when they said come down i threw up
oohgrowin up i took month-long vacations in the stratosphere and you know its really hard to hold your breath
i swear i lost everything i ever loved or feared i was the cosmic kid in full costume dress
well my feet they finally took root in the earth but i got me a nice little place in the stars
and i swear i found the key to the universe in the engine of an old parked car
i hid in the mother breast of the crowd but when they said pull down i pulled up
oohgrowin up
oohgrowin up cant see nothin in front of me
cant see nothin coming up behind
make my way through this darkness
i cant feel nothing but this chain that binds me

somewhere along the line i slipped off track
im caught movin one step up and two steps back theres a girl across the bar
i get the message shes sendin
mmm she aint lookin to married
and me well honey im pretending
last night i dreamed i held you in my arms
the music was never-ending
we danced as the evening sky faded to black
one step up and two steps back last night i dreamed that i was a child
out where the pines grow wild and tall
i was trying to make it home through the forest
before the darkness falls i heard the wind rustling through the trees
and ghostly voices rose from the fields
i ran with my heart pounding down that broken path
with the devil snapping at my heels i broke through the trees and there in the night
my fathers house stood shining hard and bright
the branches and brambles tore my clothes and scratched my arms
but i ran till i fell shaking in his arms i awoke and i imagined the hard things that pulled us apart
will never again sir tear us from each others hearts
i got dressed and to that house i did ride
from out on the road i could see its windows shining in light i walked up the steps and stood on the porch
a woman i didnt recognize came and spoke to me through a chained door
i told her my story and who id come for
she said im sorry son but no one by that name lives here anymore my fathers house shines hard and bright
it stands like a beacon calling me in the night
calling and calling so cold and alone
shining cross this dark highway where our sins lie unatoned well you dont like dont like the way i walk
and you dont like dont like the way i talk
you criticize about me endlessly
logic defies how you get stuck with me
and you complain about the clothes i wear
and you explain theres other boys out there

whoaaa we played king of the mountain out on the end
the world come chargin up the hill and we were women and men
now theres so much that time time and memory fade away
we got our own roads to ride and chances we gotta take
we stood side by side each one fightin for the other
we said until we died wed always be blood brothers now the hardness of this world slowly grinds your dreams away
makin a fools joke out of the promises we make
and what once seemed black and white turns to so many shades of gray
we lose ourselves in work to do and bills to pay
and its a ride ride ride and there aint much cover
with no one runnin by your side my blood brother on through the houses of the dead past those fallen in their tracks
always movin ahead and never lookin back
now i dont know how i feel i dont know how i feel tonight
if ive fallen neath the wheel if ive lost or ive gained sight
i dont even know why i dont know why i made this call
or if any of this matters anymore after all but the stars are burnin bright like some mistery uncovered
ill keep movin through the dark with you in my heart
my blood brother do you still say your prayers little darlin
do you go to bed at night
prayin that tomorrow everything will be alright
but tomorrows fall in number
in number one by one
you wake up and youre dying

you been shot in the back
baby point blank you been fooled this time
little girl thats a fact
right between the eyes baby point blank
right between the pretty lies that they tell
little girl you fell you grew up where young girls they grow up fast
you took what you were handed and left behind what was asked
but what they asked baby wasnt right
you didnt have to live that life
i was gonna be your romeo you were gonna be my juliet
these days you dont wait on romeos
you wait on that welfare check
and on all the pretty things that you cant ever have
and on all the promises that always end up point blank
shot between the eyes
oh point blank
like little white lies you tell to ease the pain
youre walkin in the sights girl of point blank
and its one false move and baby the lights go out once i dreamed we were together again
baby you and me
back home in those old clubs the way we used to be
we were standin at the bar
it was hard to hear
the band was playin loud and you were shoutin somethin in my ear
you pulled my jacket off and as the drummer counted four
you grabbed my hand and pulled me out on the floor
you just stood there and held me then you started dancin slow
and as i pulled you tighter i swore id never let you go well i saw you last night down on the avenue
your face was in the shadows but i knew that it was you
you were standin in the doorway out of the rain
you didnt answer when i called out your name
you just turned and then you looked away
like just another stranger waitin to get blown away point blank
right between the eyes
oh point blank
right between the pretty lies you fell
point blank
shot straight through the heart yeah point blank
youve been twisted up til youve become just another part of it
point blank youre walkin in the sights
point blank
livin one false move just one false move away
point blank
they caught you in their sights
point blank
did you forget how to love
girl did you forget how to fight
point blank
they must have shot you in the head
cause point blank
bang bang baby youre dead woke up this morning was a chill in the air
went into the kitchen your cigarettes were lying there
your jacket hung on the chair where you left it last night
everything was in place everything was all right
but you were missing
missing last night i dreamed the sky went black
you were drifting down and you couldnt get back
you were lost and in trouble so far from home
i reached for you my arms went to stone
i woke and you were missing
missing i searched for something to explain
in the whispering rain the trembling leaves
tell me baby where did you go
you were here just a moment ago theres nights i still hear your footsteps fall
your key in the door your voice in the hall
your smell drifts through our bedroom
i wake but i dont move with her killer graces and her secret places that no boy can fill
with her hands on her hips oh and that smile on her lips because she knows that it kills me
with her soft french cream standing in that doorway like a dream i wish shed just leave me alone
because french cream wont soften them boots and french kisses will not break that heart of stone
with her long hair falling and her eyes that shine like a midnight sun
whoa-oh shes the one
shes the one that thunder in your heart at night when youre kneeling in the dark
it says youre never gonna leave her
but theres this angel in her eyes that tells such desperate lies
and all you want to do is believe her
and tonight youll try just one more time to leave it all behind and to break on through
oh she can take you but if she wants to break you
shes gonna find out that aint so easy to do
and no matter where you sleep tonight or how far you run
whoa-oh shes the one
shes the one oh oh and just one kiss shes fill them long summer nights with her tenderness
that secret pact you made back when her love could save you from the bitterness
oh shes the one
oh shes the one
oh shes the one
oh shes the one
oh shes the one
oh shes the one in my dreams our love was lost
i lived by luck and faith
i carried you inside of me prayed it wouldnt be too late
now im standing on this empty road where nothing moves but the wind
and honey i just wanna be back in your arms back in your arms again
back in your arms back in your arms again oh once i was your treasure and i saw your face in every star
but these promises we make at night oh thats all they are
unless we fill them with faith and love theyre empty as a howlin wind
and honey i just wanna be back in your arms back in your arms again

back in your arms back in your arms again you came to me with love and kindness but all my life ive been a prisoner of my own blindness

to stand in the fiery furnaces of hell the rangers had a homecoming
in harlem late last night
and the magic rat drove his sleek machine
over the jersey state line
barefoot girl sitting on the hood of a dodge
drinking warm beer in the soft summer rain
the rat pulls into town rolls up his pants
together they take a stab at romance
and disappear down flamingo lane well the maximum lawmen run down flamingo
chasing the rat and the barefoot girl
and the kids round there live just like shadows
always quiet holding hands
from the churches to the jails
tonight all is silence in the world
as we take our stand
down in jungleland the midnight gangs assembled
and picked a rendezvous for the night
theyll meet neath that giant exxon sign
that brings this fair city light
man theres an opera out on the turnpike
theres a ballet being fought out in the alley
until the local cops cherry-tops rips this holy night
the streets alive as secret debts are paid
contacts made they flash unseen
kids flash guitars just like switchblades
hustling for the record machine
the hungry and the hunted
explode into rock n roll bands
that face off against each other out in the street
down in jungleland in the parking lot the visionaries dress in the latest rage
inside the backstreet girls are dancing
to the records that the dj plays
lonely-hearted lovers struggle in dark corners
desperate as the night moves on
just one look and a whisper and theyre gone beneath the city two hearts beat
soul engines running through a night so tender
in a bedroom locked in whispers
of soft refusal and then surrender
in the tunnels uptown the rats own dream guns him down
as shots echo down them hallways in the night
no one watches when the ambulance pulls away
or as the girl shuts out the bedroom light outside the streets on fire in a real death waltz
between whats flesh and whats fantasy
and the poets down here dont write nothing at all
they just stand back and let it all be
and in the quick of a knife they reach for their moment
and try to make an honest stand
but they wind up wounded not even dead
tonight in jungleland ive been working real hard trying to get my hands clean
well drive that dusty road from monroe to angeline
to buy you a gold ring and pretty dress of blue
baby just one kiss will get these things for you
a kiss to seal our fate tonight a kiss to prove it all night

and baby without check
we pulled it a little tighter around our necks
each one waiting for the other

now baby you can leave me tonight on the loose end we didnt count tomorrows
we took what we had and baby we ran
there was no place for sorrow
every place we went i held your hand

but oh no it was like we held a noose
and baby without check

i was born and christened
now ive got my story
mister no need for you to listen
its just a dead man talkin once i had a job i had a girl
but between our dreams and actions
lies this world in the deep forest
their blood and tears rushed over me
all i could feel was the drugs and the shotgun
and my fear up inside of me
like a dead man talkin neath a summer sky my eyes went black
sister i wont ask for forgiveness
my sins are all i have now the clouds above my prison
move slowly across the sky
theres a new day comin
and my dreams are full tonight i was eight years old and running with a dime in my hand
into the bus stop to pick up a paper for my old man
id sit on his lap in that big old buick and steer as we drove through town
hed tousle my hair and say son take a good look around
this is your hometown
this is your hometown
this is your hometown
this is your hometown in 65 tension was running high at my high school
there was a lot of fights between the black and white
there was nothing you could do
two cars at a light on a saturday night in the back seat there was a gun
words were passed in a shotgun blast
troubled times had come
to my hometown
my hometown
my hometown
my hometown now main streets whitewashed windows and vacant stores
seems like there aint nobody wants to come down here no more
theyre closing down the textile mill across the railroad tracks
foreman says these jobs are going boys and they aint coming back

your hometown last night me and kate we laid in bed
talking about getting out
packing up our bags maybe heading south
im thirty five we got a boy of our own now

seem like the whole world walking pretty and you cant find the room to move
well everybody better move over thats all
cause im running on the bad side and i got my back to the wall
tenth avenue freeze-out
tenth avenue freeze-out well i was stranded in the jungle trying to take in all the heat they was giving
the night is dark but the sidewalks bright and lined with the light of the living
from a tenement window a transistor blasts
turn around the corner things got real quiet real fast
i walked into a tenth avenue freeze-out
tenth avenue freeze-out and im all alone im all alone
and kid you better get the picture
and im on my own im on my own
and i cant go home when the change was made uptown and the big man joined the band
from the coastline to the city all the little pretties raise their hands
im gonna sit back right easy and laugh
when scooter and the big man bust this city in half
with the tenth avenue freeze-out
tenth avenue freeze-out
tenth avenue freeze-out
tenth avenue freeze

yeah im looking for a lover who will come on in and cover me in candys room there are pictures of her heroes on the wall
but to get to candys room you gotta walk the darkness of candys hall
strangers from the city call my babys number and they bring her toys
when i come knocking she smiles pretty she knows i want to be candys boy theres a sadness hidden in that pretty face
a sadness all her own
from which no man can keep candy safe we kiss my hearts pumpin to my brain
and the blood rushes in my veins the fire rushes towards the skies
i go driving driving deep into the night
i go driving deep into the light in candys eyes she says baby if you want to be wild
you got a lot to learn close your eyes
let them melt let them fire
let them burn
cause in the darkness therell be hidden worlds that shine
when i hold candy close she makes the hidden worlds mine she has fancy clothes and diamond rings
she has men who give her anything she wants but they dont see
that what she wants is me oh and i want her so
ill never let her go no no no
she knows that id give
all that i got to give
all that i want all that i live
to make candy mine
tonight shell let you in her house
if you come knockin late at night
shell let you in her mouth
if the words you say are right if you pay the price
shell let you deep inside
but theres a secret garden she hides shell let you in her car
to go drivin round
shell let you into the parts of herself
thatll bring you down shell let you in herheart
if you got a hammer and a vise
but into her secret garden dont think twice youve gone a million miles
how fard you get
to that place where you cant remember
and you cant forget shell lead you down a path
therell be tenderness in the air
shell let you come just far enough
so you know shes really there
shell look at you and smile
and her eyes will say
shes got a secret garden
where everything you want
where everything you need
will always stay
a million miles away you stare in the mirror at the lines in your face
and you try so hard to see
the way things were when we were at your place
everyday was just you and me
and you cry because things aint like before
well dont you know it cant be that way anymore
but dont worry baby
cause i cant talk now im not alone
so put your ear close to the phone
cause this is the last dance the last chance
for hearts of stone if there was something baby
that i could do
something that would last honey i would
but you should know better than to think that you
can return to the past
so close your eyes and ill be there
hold you once more and not go anywhere
i wish i could babe
but i cant talk now im not alone
so put your ear close to the phone
cause this is the last dance the last chance
for hearts of stone and you cry because things get so strange so fast
and you cry because nothing good ever lasts
well i know babe
but i cant talk now im not alone
so put your ear close to the phone
cause this is the last dance the last chance
for hearts of stone
i cant talk now im not alone
so put your ear close to the phone
cause this is the last dance the last chance
for hearts of stone i went out walking the other day
seen a little girl crying along the way
shed been hurt so bad said shed never love again
some day your crying girl will end
and youll find once again two hearts are better than one
two hearts girl get the job done
two hearts are better than one once i spent my time playing tough guy scenes
but i was living in a world of childish dreams
someday these childish dreams must end
to become a man and grow up to dream again
i believe in the end two hearts are better than one
two hearts girl get the job done
two hearts are better than one sometimes it might seem like it was planned
for you to roam empty-hearted through this land
though the world turns you hard and cold
theres one thing mister that i know
thats if you think your heart is stone
and that youre rough enough to whip this world alone
alone buddy there aint no peace of mind
thats why ill keep searching til i find my special one two hearts are better than one
two hearts girl get the job done
two hearts are better than one oh two hearts are better than one
two hearts girl get the job done
two hearts are better than one woah [verse 1]
they come from everywhere
a longing to be free
they come to join us here
from sea to shining sea and they all have a dream
as people always will
to be safe and warm
in that shining city on the hill some wanna slam the door
instead of opening the gate
aw lets turn this thing around
before it gets too late [chorus]
its up to me and you
love can conquer hate
i know this to be true
thats what makes us great [verse 2]
dont tell me a lie
and sell it as a fact
ive been down that road before
and i aint goin back and dont you brag to me
that you never read a book
i never put my faith
in a con man and his crooks i wont follow down that path
and tempt the hands of fate
aw lets turn this thing around
before it gets too late [chorus]
its up to me and you
love can conquer hate
i know this to be true
thats what makes us great in the quiet of the night
i lie here wide awake
and i ask myself
is there a difference i can make [chorus]
its up to me and you
love can conquer hate
i know this to be true
thats what makes us great
