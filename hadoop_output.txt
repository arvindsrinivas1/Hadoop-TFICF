madman
drummers
bummers

indians
in

summer
with
a
teenage
diplomat
in
the
dumps
with

mumps
as
the
adolescent
pumps
his
way
into
his
hat
with
a
boulder
on
my
shoulder
feelin
kinda
older
i
tripped
the
merry-go-round
with
this
very
unpleasing
sneezing
and
wheezing
the
calliope
crashed
to
the
ground
some
all-hot
half-shot
was
headin
for
the
hot
spot
snappin
his
fingers
clappin
his
hands
and
some
fleshpot
mascot
was
tied
into
a
lovers
knot
with
a
whatnot
in
her
hand
and
now
young
scott
with
a
slingshot
finally
found
a
tender
spot
and
throws
his
lover
in
the
sand
and
some
bloodshot
forget-me-not
whispers
daddys
within
earshot
save
the
buckshot
turn
up
the
band
and
she
was
blinded
by
the
light
oh
cut
loose
like
a
deuce
another
runner
in
the
night
blinded
by
the
light
she
got
down

tight

from
the
east

the
dictaphone

it
in

funny
bone

some
new-mown
chaperone

standin
in
the
corner
all
alone
watchin
the
young
girls
dance
and
some
fresh-sown
moonstone
was
messin
with
his
frozen
zone
to
remind
him
of
the
feeling
of
romance
yeah

to
read
your
mind
to

what
ive
got
in
this
new
thing
ive
found
so
tell
me
what
i
see
when
i
look
in
your
eyes
is
that
you
baby
or
just
a
brilliant
disguise
i
heard
somebody
call
your
name
from
underneath
our
willow
i
saw
something
tucked
in
shame
underneath
your
pillow
well
ive
tried
so
hard
baby
but
i
just
cant
see
what
a
woman
like
you
is
doing
with
me
so
tell
me
who
i
see
when
i
look
in
your
eyes
is
that
you
baby
or
just
a
brilliant
disguise
now
look
at
me
baby
struggling
to
do
everything

walk
this
world
in

at

suspended
in
my
masquerade
i
combed
my
hair
till
it
was
just
right
and
commanded
the
night
brigade
i
was
open
to
pain
and
crossed
by
the
rain
and
i
walked
on
a
crooked
crutch
i
strolled
all
alone
through
a
fallout
zone
and
come
out
with
my
soul
untouched
i
hid
in
the
clouded
wrath
of
the
crowd
but
when
they
said
sit
down
i
stood
up
oohgrowin
up
the
flag
of
piracy
flew
from
my
mast
my
sails
were
set
wing
to
wing
i
had
a
jukebox
graduate
for
first
mate
she
couldnt
sail
but
she
sure
could
sing
i
pushed
b-52
and
bombed
them
with
the
blues
with
my
gear
set
stubborn
on
standing
i
broke
all
the
rules
strafed
my
old
high
school
never
once
gave
thought
to
landing
i
hid
in
the
clouded
wrath
of
the
crowd
but
when
they
said
come
down
i
threw
up
oohgrowin
up
i
took
month-long
vacations
in
the
stratosphere
and
you
know
its
really
hard
to
hold
your
breath

everything

loved
or
feared
i
was
the
cosmic
kid
in
full
costume

well
my
feet
they
finally
took
root
in
the
earth
but
i
got
me
a
nice
little
place
in
the
stars
and
i
swear
i
found
the
key
to
the
universe
in
the
engine
of
an
old
parked
car
i
hid
in
the
mother
breast
of
the
crowd
but
when
they
said
pull
down
i
pulled
up
oohgrowin

well

im
pretending
last

i
dreamed
i
held
you
in
my
arms
the
music
was
never-ending
we
danced
as
the
evening
sky
faded
to
black
one
step
up
and
two
steps
back
last
night
i
dreamed
that
i
was
a
child
out
where
the
pines
grow
wild
and
tall
i
was
trying
to
make
it
home
through
the
forest
before
the
darkness
falls
i
heard
the
wind
rustling
through
the
trees
and
ghostly
voices
rose
from
the
fields
i
ran
with
my
heart
pounding
down
that
broken
path
with
the
devil
snapping
at
my
heels
i
broke
through
the
trees
and
there
in
the
night
my
fathers
house
stood
shining
hard
and
bright
the
branches
and
brambles
tore
my
clothes
and
scratched
my
arms
but
i
ran
till
i
fell
shaking
in
his
arms
i
awoke
and
i
imagined
the
hard
things
that
pulled
us
apart
will
never
again
sir
tear
us
from
each
others
hearts
i
got
dressed
and
to
that
house
i
did
ride
from
out
on
the
road
i
could
see
its
windows
shining
in
light
i
walked
up
the
steps
and
stood
on
the
porch
a
woman
i
didnt
recognize
came
and
spoke
to
me
through
a
chained
door
i
told
her
my
story
and
who
id
come
for
she
said
im
sorry
son
but
no
one
by
that
name
lives
here
anymore
my
fathers
house
shines
hard
and
bright
it
stands
like
a
beacon
calling
me
in
the
night
calling
and
calling
so
cold
and
alone
shining
cross
this
dark
highway
where
our
sins
lie
unatoned
well

dont
like

like
the
way

walk
and

shoutin
somethin
in
my
ear
you
pulled
my
jacket
off
and

the
drummer
counted
four
you
grabbed
my
hand
and
pulled
me
out
on
the
floor

there
and
held
me
then
you
started
dancin
slow
and
as
i
pulled
you
tighter
i
swore

never
let
you
go
well
i
saw
you
last
night
down
on
the
avenue
your
face
was
in
the
shadows
but
i
knew
that
it
was
you
you
were
standin
in
the
doorway
out
of
the
rain
you
didnt
answer
when
i
called
out
your
name
you
just
turned
and
then
you
looked
away
like
just
another
stranger
waitin
to
get
blown
away
point
blank
right
between
the
eyes
oh
point
blank
right
between
the
pretty
lies
you
fell
point
blank
shot
straight
through
the
heart

twisted
up
til

become
just
another
part
of
it

blank
livin
one
false

their
sights

in
the
head

point
blank
bang

baby
youre
dead
woke
up
this
morning
was
a
chill
in
the
air
went
into
the
kitchen
your
cigarettes
were
lying
there
your
jacket
hung
on
the
chair
where
you
left
it
last
night
everything
was
in
place
everything
was
all
right
but
you
were
missing
missing
last
night
i
dreamed
the
sky
went
black
you
were
drifting
down
and
you
couldnt
get
back
you
were
lost
and
in
trouble
so
far
from
home
i
reached
for
you
my
arms
went
to
stone
i
woke
and
you
were
missing
missing
i
searched
for
something
to
explain
in
the
whispering
rain
the
trembling
leaves
tell
me
baby
where
did
you
go
you
were
here
just
a
moment
ago
theres
nights
i
still
hear
your
footsteps
fall
your
key
in
the
door
your
voice
in
the
hall
your
smell
drifts
through
our
bedroom
i
wake
but
i
dont
move
with
her
killer
graces
and
her
secret
places
that
no
boy
can
fill
with
her
hands
on
her
hips
oh
and
that
smile
on
her
lips
because
she
knows
that
it
kills
me
with
her
soft
french
cream
standing
in
that
doorway
like
a
dream
i
wish
shed
just
leave
me
alone
because
french
cream
wont
soften
them
boots
and
french
kisses
will
not
break
that
heart
of
stone
with
her
long
hair
falling
and
her
eyes
that
shine
like
a
midnight
sun
whoa-oh
shes
the
one
shes
the
one
that
thunder
in
your
heart
at
night
when
youre
kneeling
in
the
dark
it
says
youre
never
gonna
leave
her
but
theres
this
angel
in
her
eyes
that
tells
such
desperate
lies
and
all
you
want
to
do
is
believe
her
and
tonight
youll
try
just
one
more
time
to
leave
it
all
behind
and
to
break
on
through
oh
she
can
take
you
but
if
she
wants
to
break
you
shes
gonna
find
out
that
aint
so
easy
to
do
and
no
matter
where
you
sleep
tonight
or
how
far
you
run
whoa-oh
shes
the
one
shes
the
one
oh
oh
and
just
one
kiss
shes
fill
them
long
summer
nights
with
her
tenderness
that
secret
pact
you
made
back
when
her
love
could
save
you
from
the
bitterness
oh
shes
the
one
oh
shes
the
one
oh
shes
the
one
oh
shes
the
one
oh
shes
the
one
oh
shes
the
one

my
dreams

the
magic
rat
drove
his
sleek
machine
over
the
jersey
state
line
barefoot
girl
sitting
on
the
hood
of
a
dodge
drinking
warm
beer
in
the
soft
summer
rain
the
rat
pulls
into
town
rolls
up
his
pants
together
they
take
a
stab
at
romance
and
disappear
down
flamingo
lane
well
the
maximum
lawmen
run
down
flamingo
chasing
the
rat
and
the
barefoot
girl
and
the
kids
round
there
live
just
like
shadows
always
quiet
holding
hands
from
the
churches
to
the
jails
tonight
all
is
silence
in
the
world
as
we
take
our
stand
down
in
jungleland
the
midnight
gangs
assembled
and
picked
a
rendezvous
for
the
night
theyll
meet
neath
that
giant
exxon
sign
that
brings
this
fair
city
light
man
theres
an
opera
out
on
the
turnpike
theres
a
ballet
being
fought
out
in
the
alley
until
the
local
cops
cherry-tops
rips
this
holy
night
the
streets
alive
as
secret
debts
are
paid
contacts
made
they
flash
unseen
kids
flash
guitars
just
like
switchblades
hustling
for
the
record
machine
the
hungry
and
the
hunted
explode
into
rock
n
roll
bands
that
face
off
against
each
other
out
in
the
street
down
in
jungleland
in
the
parking
lot
the
visionaries
dress
in
the
latest
rage
inside
the
backstreet
girls
are
dancing
to
the
records
that
the
dj
plays
lonely-hearted
lovers
struggle
in
dark
corners
desperate
as
the
night
moves
on
just
one
look
and
a
whisper
and
theyre
gone
beneath
the
city
two
hearts
beat
soul
engines
running
through
a
night
so
tender
in
a
bedroom
locked
in
whispers
of
soft
refusal
and
then
surrender
in
the
tunnels
uptown
the
rats
own
dream
guns
him
down
as
shots
echo
down
them
hallways
in
the
night
no
one
watches
when
the
ambulance
pulls
away
or
as
the
girl
shuts
out
the
bedroom
light
outside
the
streets
on
fire
in
a
real
death
waltz
between
whats
flesh
and
whats
fantasy
and
the
poets
down
here
dont
write
nothing
at
all
they
just
stand
back
and
let
it
all
be
and
in
the
quick
of
a
knife
they
reach
for
their
moment
and
try
to
make
an
honest
stand
but

up
wounded

when

out
all
the
life
that
out
love
could
hold
no

was
like
we
held
a
noose
and
baby
without
check

pulled
it
a
little
tighter
around
our
necks
each
one
waiting
for
the
other
darling
to
say
when

no
place
for
sorrow

held
your
hand
and
when
the
night
closed
in
i
was

me
all
i
had
to
know
but

was
like
we
held
a
noose
and

pulled
til

grew
tighter
around
our
necks
each
one
waiting
for
the
other
darling
to
say
when
oh

you
can
leave
me
tonight

the
loose
end
our
love

fallen
around

and
i
used
to
walk
around
town
and
i
had
you

a
couple
of
pairs
of
levis
and
a
couple
t-shirts
and
i
thought
i
had
my
shit
pretty
good
together
man
you

i
was
out
on
the
streets
talking
and
talking
doing
all

i
found
a
nice
piece
of
talent
he
went
right
straight
downstairs
to
the
chick
on
the
second
floor
there
was
another
chick
on
the
second

er
er

ha
ha
ha
did

down
the
aisles

no
i
was
er

was
a
painter

a
sort
of
a
recluse
in
high
school
ive
changed
what
happened
i
got
liberated
i
dont
know
i
just
started
to
sing
and
singing
makes
you
want
to
come
out
because
painting
i
feel
keeps
you
inside
you
know
and
once
you
start
singing
you
just
sort
of
wa
o
talk
to
people
more
and
go
out
more
and
you
know
your
lifestyles
becomes
more
a
come-out
flow-out
thing

a
hold-it-and-be-quiet
type
how
were
you
different
from
your
schoolmates
when
you
were
a
teenager

you
ask

apart
from

take
a
part

the
high
school
prom
and
er
oh

were
asked
werent

dont
think

think

wanted
to
take
me
till

encontrar
una
manera
y
dile
a

todos

que

así
que

que
el

por

que
lo
que

ser
mi
amor
es
como
bala
todo
lo
que
necesita
es
una
inyección
para
mí
para
hacer
estallar
todo
por
la
borda

sentir
que
estoy

el
tiempo

a
estar
con
ustedes

una
inyección
para

dont
they
love
to
see
you

kick

while

on
the
ground
dont
let

hmm
people
always
speculate
dont
let

get
in
your
way
see
they
say
things
they
dont

ooh
wait
til
you
see
my
smile
ooh
wait
til
they
see
your
smile
hey
so
youre
doing
better

ooh
wait

til
you
see

if
war
is
holy
and
sex
is
obscene
weve
got
it
twisted
in
this
lucid
dream
baptized
in
boundaries
schooled
in
sin
divided
by
difference
sexuality
and
skin
oh
so
we
can
hate
each
other
and
fear
each
other
we
can
build
these
walls
between
each
other
baby
blow
by
blow
and
brick
by
brick
keep
yourself
locked
in
yourself
locked
in
yeah
we
can
hate
each
other
and
fear
each
other
we
can
build
these
walls
between
each
other
baby
blow
by
blow
and
brick
by
brick
keep
yourself
locked
in
yourself
locked
oh
maybe
we
should
love
somebody
oh
maybe
we
could
care
a
little
more
so
maybe
we
should
love
somebody
instead
of
polishing
the
bombs
of
holy
war
what
if
sex
was
holy
and
war
was
obscene
and
it
wasnt
twisted
what
a
wonderful
dream
living
for
love
unafraid
of
the
end
forgiveness
is
the
only
real
revenge
oh
so
we
can
heal
each
other
and
fill
each
other
we
can
break
these
walls
between
each
other
baby
blow
by
blow
and
brick
by
brick
keep
yourself
open
yourself
open
yeah
we
can
heal
each
other
and
fill
each
other
we
can
break
these
walls
between
each
other
baby
blow
by
blow
and
brick
by
brick
keep
yourself
open
youre
open
so
maybe
we
should
love
somebody
maybe
we
could
care
a
little
more
so
maybe
we
should
love
somebody
instead
of
polishing
the
bombs
of
holy
war
what
if
love
is
holy
and
hate
obscene
we
should
give
life
to
this
beautiful
dream
cause
peace
and
love
aint
so
far
if
we
nurse
our
wounds
before
they
scar
nurse
our
wounds
before
they
scar
there
will
never
come
a
day
you
will
ever
hear
me
say
that
i
want
or
need
to
be
without
you
i
wanna
give
my
all
baby
just
hold
me
sweetly
control
me
because
your
arms
they
keep
away
the
lonely
when
i
look
into
your
eyes
then
i
realize
all
i
need
is
you
in
my
life
all
i
need
is
you
in
my
life
cause
i
never
felt
this
way
about
loving
no
never
felt
so
alive

felt
this
way
about
loving
it
feels
so
good
and
everybody
know
the
story
of
david
and
goliath
but
this
is
bigger
than
triumph
this
is
for
the
warrior
this
is
for
you
and
i
this
is
for
euphoria
give
me
a
piece
of
mind
god

recording
this
wont
you
look
in
the
sky
tell
him
you
got
the
behavior
of
your
neighbor
even
when

never
in
your
favor
fly
with
the
turbulence
only
last
a
minute
land
on
your
dreams
and
recognize
you
live
it
walk
through
the
valley
of
peace
with
bare
feet
run
through
the
flames

thief
in
the
night
stolen
moments
with
you
oh

such
a
simple
plan
simple
plan
i
was
just
a
girl
and
you
a
young
man

could
age
define
something
so
divine

divine

this
even
be
real
or
just
exist
in
my
mind
dreamin
bout
you
i
keep
dreamin
bout
you
when

dreamin
bout
when
you
would
say
[chorus]
dreamin
bout
you

dreamin
bout
you
when

dreamin
and
waiting
for
the
day
when
no
one
and
nothing
else
takes
up
our
time
finally
youre
only
mine
each
and
everyday
i
dont
walk
with
you
right
by
my
side
but
instead
we
have
to
hide
sneak
around
and
lie
just
to
spend
time
alone
this
lovin
is
a
crime
id
rather
do
the
time
and
leave
the
world
behind
[chorus]

get
away

fact
that
youre
alive
is
a
miracle

stay
alive
that
would
be
enough
and
if
this
child
shares
a
fraction
of
your
smile
or
a
fragment
of
your
mind
look
out
world
that
would
be
enough
i
dont
pretend
to
know
the
challenges
youre
facing
the
worlds
you
keep
erasing
and
creating
in
your
mind
but
im
not
afraid
i
know
who
i
married
so
long
as
you
come
home
at
the
end
of
the
day
that
would
be
enough
we
dont
need
a
legacy
we
dont
need
money
if
i
could
grant
you
peace
of
mind
if
you
could
let
me
inside
your
heart
oh
let
me
be
a
part
of
the
narrative
in
the
story
they
will
write
someday
let
this
moment
be
the
first
chapter
where
you
decide
to
stay
and
i
would
be
enough
and
this
could
be
enough
this
would
be
enough
said
i
would
be
enough
and
this
could
be
enough
see
we
could
be
enough
oh
baby

could
be
enough

could
be
enough

be
enough

the
story
of
jesus
so
easy
to
explain
after
they
crucified
him
a
woman
she
claimed
his
name
the
story
of
jesus
the
whole
bible
knows
went
all
across
the
desert
and
in
the
middle
he
found
a
rose
there
should
be
no
questions
there
should
be
no
lies
he
was
married
ever
happily
after
all
the
tears
we
cry
no
use
in
arguing
all
the
use
to
the
man
that
moans
when
each
man
falls
in
battle
his
soul
it
has
to
roam
angles
of
heaven
flying
saucers
to
some
made
easter
sunday
the
name
of
the
rising
sun
the
story
is
written
by
so
many
people
who
dared
to
lay
down
the
truth
to
so
very
many
who
cared
to
carry
the
cross
of
jesus
and
beyond
we
will
guide
the
light
this
time
with
a
woman
in
our
arms
we
as
men
cant
explain
the
reason
why
the
womans
always
mentioned
at
the
moment
that
we
die
all
we
know
is
god
is
by
our
side
and
he
says
the
word
so
easy
yet
so
hard
i
wish
not
to
be
alone
so
i
must
respect
my
other
heart

castles
made

fall
in
the

eventually
a
little
indian
brave
who
before
he
was
ten
played
war
games
in
the
woods
with
his
indian
friends
and
he
built
the
dream
that
when
he
grew
up
he
would
be
a
fearless
warrior
indian
chief
many
moons
past
and
more
the
dream
grew
strong
until
tomorrow
he
would
sing
his
first
war
song
and
fight
his
first
battle
but
something
went
wrong
surprise
attack
killed
him
in
his
sleep
that
night
and
so
castles
made
of
sand
melts
into
the
sea
eventually
there
was
a
young
girl
whos
heart
was
a
frown
cause
she
was
crippled
for
life
and
she
couldnt
speak
a
sound
and
she
wished
and
prayed
she
could
stop
living
so
she
decided
to
die
she
drew
her
wheelchair
to
the
edge
of
the
shore
and
to
her
legs
she
smiled
you
wont
hurt
me
no
more
but
then
a
sight
shed
never
seen
made
her
jump
and
say
look
a
golden
winged
ship
is
passing
my
way
and
it
really
didnt
have
to
stop
it
just
kept
on
going
and
so
castles
made
of
sand
slips
into
the
sea

me
a
story
yesterday

the
sweet
love
between
the

yes
the
willows
weep
among
for
me
the
birds
sang
the
love
song
my
babys
caused
my
heart
to
bleed
she
walks
with
a
bell-clock
round
her
neck
so
the
hippies
think
shes
in
with
time
time
her
hair
glistens
like
robins
on
a
deck
branches
attack
me
from
her
neck
shes
so
fine
shes
so
very
very
fine
the
sun
from
a
cloud
sinks
into
her
eyes
the
rain
from
a
tree
soaks
into
her
mind
mind
morning
sign
sounds
just
like
a
lock
all
these
signs
are
always
a
stock
shes
so
fine
shes
so
very
very
fine
when
i
veer
i
get
so
near
but
so
far
far
far
away
listen
to
me
today
we
united
just
beside
a
leaf
the
ground
was
hard
underneath
her
ahhhahhh
shes
so
fine
ahhhahhh
the
morning
is
dead
and
the
day
is
too
theres
nothing
left
here
to
meet
me
but
the
velvet
moon
all
my
loneliness
i
have
felt
today
its
like
a
little
more
than
enough
to
make
a
man
throw
himself
away
and
i
continue
to
burn
the
midnight
lamp
alone
now
the
smiling
portrait
of
you
is
still
hangin
on
my
frowning
wall
it
really
doesnt
really
doesnt
bother
me
too
much
at
all
its
just
the
ever
falling
dust
that
makes
it
so
hard
for
me
to
see
that
forgotten
earring
layin
on
the
floor
facing
coldly
towards
the
door
i
continue
to
burn
the
midnight
lamp
lord
alone
loneliness
is
such
a
drag
so
here
i
sit
to
face
that
same
old
fire
place
gettin
ready
for
the
same
old
explosion
goin
through
my
mind
and
soon
enough
time
will
tell
about
the
circus
in
the
wishing
well
and
someone
who
will
buy
and
sell
for
me
someone
to
toll
my
bell
and
i
continue
to
burn
this
old
lamp

they
also
said
its
impossible
for
a
man
to
live
and
breathe
under
water
forever
was
the
main
complaint
and
they
also
threw
this
in
my
face
they
said
anyway
you
know
good
and
well
it
would
be
beyond
the
will
of
god
and
the
grace
of
the
king
grace
of
the
king
yeah

hmmm
yeah
well
well
well
dig
dig
id
like
to
get
something
strait
we
umm
we
got
tired
of
the
experience
and
every
once
in
a
while
were
blowing
our
minds
too
much
so
we
decided
to
change
everything
around
and
a
call
it
gypsy
sons
and
rainbows
for
short
nothin
but
a
band
of
gypsies
we
have
billy
cox
playin
bass
and
um
from
nashville
tennessee
we
have
lary
lee
playin
guitar
over
there
we
got
juma
playin
congos
over
there
juma
and
we
have
granny
goose
oh
im
sorry
mitch
mitchell
on
drums
over
there
and
we
got
jerry
velez
on
congos
too
you
got
yours
truly
on
pete
whistle
what
me
worry
gives
us
about
a
minute
and
a
half
to
tune
up
ok
like
we
only
had
about
two
rehearsals
so
a
well
only
do
a
primary
rhythm
thing
someone
in
the
background
i
have
mine
thank
you
i
have
mine
thank
you
baby
black
is
gold
is
pure
and
true
kings
of
this
earth
1
so
i
say
its
up
to
us
to
straighten
out
this
mess
we
got
to
go
through
hell
and
then
thats
the
last
of
this
miserable
test
2
black
must
be
bold
because
its
gold
and
true
kings
of
this
world
so
let
them
go
to
the
moon
yes
let
them
go
to
mars
because
deep
down
inside
theyre
really
from
the
stars
3
thats
why
they
dont
want
us
to
mixjust
the
way
the
word
of
god
had
said
so
let
them
go
to
saturnthats
where
theyll
learn
instead
because
black
and
white
together
is
right
and
white
by
itself
is
an
egotistic
elf
4
so
they
show
you
how
to
killand
if
you
dont
they
will
what
do
they
know
about
happiness
how
can
they
about
life
they
just
got
lost
in
space
so
when
they
landed
atlantis
cried
so
if
theyre
so
alone
try
to
make
them
feel
at
home
so
let
them
fetch
you
fire
wood
and
let
them
nibble
on
the
bone
so
invent
a
word
called
love
and
then
they
blame
our
mistakes
on
god
dont
you
know
how
lonely
they
must
be
so
many
light
years
from
home
hey
soulful
people
im
calling
dont
be
no
more
slaves
because
god
will
protect
us
when
it
comes
to
doomsday
realize
before
its
too
late
that
no
one
on
earth
will
escape
we
are
the
kings
of
earth
and
axis
gonna
put
them
slaves
they
killed
so
many
worlds
before
but
they
will
pass
sentence
upon
themselves
when
the
earth
opens
upwill
they
be
saved
from
our
hell
i
feel
the
truth
of
life
we
better
all
realize
people
like
me
and
you
we
feel
so
bad
dont
know
what
to
do
they
keep
us
high
low
on
drugs
and
they
got
us
making
their
rugs
as
we
go
dripping
blood
but
the
sun
knows
as
the
wind
blows
and
the
fire
grows
towards
the
far
shores
and
the
water
foams
to
make
steamed
bones
of
all
of
those
who
dont
belive
that
black
is
gold
is
the
kings
of
this
world
we
all
better
get
our
places
before
god
tells
us
to
our
face
we
arepast
the
human
race
lets
pray
that
we
all
agree
we
got
to
straighten
out
the
family
tree
life
is
for
you
and
me
togather
thats
the
way
it
was
meant
to
be
white
man
watch
your
mouth
because
our
drums
they
face
the
south
and
you
cant
kill
the
god
that
kept
you
alive
between
the
poles
of
the
north
and
south
you
better
adjust
your
place
in
this
worldbefore
your
hair
it
starts
to
curland
the
yellow
red
and
black
of
this
world
will
tear
your
ass
and
soul
apart
where
is
he
coming
from
from
heaven
where
1000000
worlds
are
one
where
is
he
going
to
hes
going
to
make
contact
with
the
living
and
the
dead
here
comes
black
gold
gather
round
young
and
old
hes
going
to
be
felt
by
the
timid
and
the
bold
within
a
wink
of
an
eye
with
the
wink
of
an
eye
egos
swell
bust
and
die
kingdoms
fall
and
cry
with
the
wink
of
an
eye
with
the
wink
of
an
eye
a
new
born
baby
cries
and
a
100
soldiers
die
with
the
wink
of
an
eye
